# GCRNet
***

GCRNet is a fragments reassmebly framework based on graph generation strategy and deep learning method. This model concentrates more on the prediction of pairwise matches. The following image is the whole process of the algorithim.

## 1.environment
***

Our model is implemented on the Ubuntu16.04. We use pytorch to build the module and run the experiments. If you want to run the codes mentioned in this project, these additional packages are needed:
- python3.6
- pytorch
- opencv
- py

## 2.datases
***

In our comparative experiment we use the magazine dataset set up by richer, MIT and BGU datasets. You can download these data here.
